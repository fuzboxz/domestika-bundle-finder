# Domestika Bundle Finder

ARCHIVED - script no longer works due to CloudFlare anti-bot countermeasures

Looking for a couple of courses but don't want to manually check all the different Domestika bundles? Use this tool to search for a deal. 
Requires Python 3.8+, tested with 3.9.

## Usage
- Install requirements using pip3 -r requirements.txt
- domestika-bundle-finder.py "search for the bundles" "you want to buy" "and hopefully you will find something" 
- Use --update switch to force a "db" update 
    - This will happen automatically the first time or if you haven't updated in a week
